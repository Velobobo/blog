ðŸ‘‹ Hey, Iâ€™m Velobobo

Iâ€™m just starting out on my journey into binary exploitation, reverse engineering, and low-level systems. I find it really fun (and frustrating sometimes) to poke around at how things work under the surface.

This blog is mostly a place for me to post writeups, and walkthroughs from challenges or wargames Iâ€™ve tried â€” kind of like a learning log. I'm still figuring things out as I go, so donâ€™t expect expert stuff â€” just honest attempts and what Iâ€™ve picked up along the way.
If youâ€™re learning too, maybe something here will help or make you curious enough to dive in yourself.

Feel free to reach me out on Discord: velobobo
